# cloudbuild-task

[![GitHub Actions status](https://github.com/aarnott/cloudbuild-task/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AArnott/cloudbuild-task/actions)

This repo contains the source code for several NPM packages
that allow for development of CI cloud build system tasks
using a shared API abstraction.
This abstraction allows the bulk of a task's code to be written once
and run in GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or locally on a dev box.
